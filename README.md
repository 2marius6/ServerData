# ServerData
 Another uni project, done in the winter semester of the second year, a web platform for viewing real-time and historical data about a number of servers.

# How it works
This project has three main components: 
- a python script, grabbing the data from a server, and sending it to the database (https://github.com/2marius6/Python-real-data-grabbber)
- a MySQL database where all data about servers is stored
- the web platform itself

# Features
